    abstract = {Several methods are available for determining the shortest route through a network. These methods are described in some detail with added remarks as to their relative merits. Most of the methods are intended for both manual and digital computation; however, two analog methods are included. Brief mention is also made of the duality between the shortest-route problem and the network capacity problem.},
